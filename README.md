# Berlin Clock

A Jetpack Compose implementation of the famous Berlin Clock. This project demonstrates clean architecture principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and MVVM pattern in Android development.

## 📱 About The Berlin Clock

The "Berlin Clock" is the first public clock in the world that tells the time by means of illuminated, coloured fields, for which it entered the Guinness Book of Records upon its installation on 17 June 1975.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:
### Key Architectural Patterns

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Reactive UI with state management
- **Clean Code**: Well-documented, single-responsibility functions
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Tests written before implementation
- **Reactive Programming**: StateFlow for real-time updates

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time Berlin Clock display
- Visual representation with colored lights
- Automatic time updates every second
- Clean, modern Material Design 3 UI
- Comprehensive unit tests
- MVVM architecture with Jetpack Compose

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **State Management**: StateFlow
- **Coroutines**: For async operations
